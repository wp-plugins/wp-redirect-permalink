WP Redirect Permalink plugin allows you to efficiently redirect your previous urls that were /postname/post_id/ to only /postname/ that WordPress doesn't do automatically.

== Description ==
WP Redirect Permalink plugin allows you to efficiently redirect your previous urls that were /postname/post_id/ to only /postname/ that WordPress doesn't do automatically.

If you've planned to change your WordPress permalink from /%postname%/%postid%/ to only /%postname%/ , although the old links still work fine, they're not automatically transferred to the new one without the post id in it. This can cause serious duplicate content issue for your site (can be seen and confirmed by Google webmaster tools). 

This plugin removed those duplicated content issues by redirecting the visitor to the new permalink with a 301 (permanently moved) status code.

This plugin takes care of pagination of categories and blog list and allows them to work normally.
